# TL866IIPlus-Firmware
Copy of TL866 II Plus firmware

This was very slow to download from xgecu.  If you are not using their software (for example, minipro on a mac or linux) you will likely need this file to update your programmer.

Not that this file is for the TL866 II Plus ONLY


To udpate the programmer via minipro is pretty easy.

> minipro -t
(lists test information for the programmer, and the current firmware version)
> minipro -F <name of update file>
(shows programming status)

You're done.
